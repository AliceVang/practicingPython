Hi, I am using this to practice Python coding and to learn more about
how to use GitHub properly for future projects.
I am using PyCharm provided by JetBrains: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/
At the time learning, I began downloaded and used python version 3.10.4: https://www.python.org/downloads/
